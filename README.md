Dog Breed Api
See https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/ for general Api documentation. Write a small Elm application that 
* Can be in one of two basic user interface states
    * Dog Breed List 
        * Loads the list of dog breeds/sub-breeds if not already loaded dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
        * Displays the list of breeds with sub-breed names displayed. The display styling need not be fancy but the list should be sorted alphabetically.
        * The user can transition to Dog Breed Details by clicking on a specific breed in the list.
    * Dog Breed Details
        * The user can return to the Dog Breed List state.
        * Loads image list from dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images. A specific breed should be loaded at most once per session.
        * Displays the total number of images for the breed.
        * Displays 20 images at a time
        * Allows the user to page forward and backward with Previous and Back buttons. The buttons should only be enabled when appropriate.  
* General Notes
    * Make a call to the underlying Api for a specific Url only once per application session / instance. The same data should not be fetched twice for the same run of the application so be certain to model that.
    * Always indicate to the user when data is loading and disallow interactions while loading.
    * Do not worry about fancy styling. Fancy styling is extra credit.  
    * In a real application these states would be represented as routes but that complexity has been excluded here to reduce the burden of plumbing code.
